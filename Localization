tutorial0- Welcome to Supermarket Together!

If you wish to skip this tutorial press the assigned Drop Item key [F by default] for five seconds.
tutorial1- While the store is closed time passes way more slowly.
            
The first step is to place some furniture. Press [TAB] to open the builder
tutorial2- Buy 2 product shelves, a checkout and a storage shelf.

Note the storage shelf can only be placed in the annex empty room connected to the manager room.
tutorial3- Good job!
            
We have a franchise point available: points are earned by owning a successful business.

Go to the manager room and acquire the first perk in the perk's blackboard.
tutorial4- Great. You have just acquired the first pack of products.

It's important to remember that once you've acquired a product franchise, customers will expect those products to be in the store or they will complain about existences.

Now go to the manager blackboard, click in it and then click in products order.
tutorial5- Good. Now click in Basic Products I.
tutorial6- Let's buy a box of each basic product.

Click on the plus symbol of each product to add it to the shopping list, once you have one of each there, click buy.
tutorial7- Great. Now go outside and look for the purchased boxes. Click on one to hold it.
tutorial8- Go to a product shelf and click [LMB] on one of its rows to fill it with products.

[RMB] will return items from the shelf to the box.

You can also press [F] to drop items where you want to.

Place all products in the store's shelves.
tutorial9- Products are placed but initially labeled at cost price which means no benefit.

Go to the manager room and take one of the pricing devices.
tutorial10- Aim at a shelf and the product pricing information will appear on the device' screen.

If your prices surpasses more than double of the product's base price customers will have an increasing chance of not buying it so use this rule as a scale.

P.e. if a product has cost 1 dollar and you set your price higher than 2 dollars customers may not buy it. Try to set a price to all six different products.

CONTROLS
[Mouse Wheel] Add or subtract in increments of 0.01.
[Mouse Wheel + E] Add or subtract in increments of 0.2.
[LMB] Accept price.
[Numpad] Can also be used.
[F] Drop items

Note you can also set prices with your numpad or reassign keys in Options/Customize Controls to do so. Numpad can be also used to input amounts when customers pay with credit card in checkouts.
    
tutorial11- Your store is now ready to open. To allow customers in press the green button located in the manager's room. But first read the important info below:

- Every Thursday market inflation increases on some products and you will have to review prices.

- You can drop empty boxes in the container just outside OR carry them to the farthest container across the street and earn some money back by recycling it. Money can be increased with a perk.

- At day 8, thieves and trash will have a chance to spawn. The solution to both is the broom: hit the thieves and they will drop their stolen products.

- Each checkout can have a queue of 8 customers, they won't become impatient but extra customers that do not detect a free checkout queue, will become thieves and leave without paying.

- You can check lights and other decoration by pressing X or Z by default while using the Builder.

- You can definitely clear a shelf row from its products by right clicking it with the pricing tool. Useful if you don't want any employees to keep restocking that row.

- Pay attention to the invoices tab in the manager's blackboard. Your employees wages and electrical or rent invoices will arrive there.

- To close the store wait until it's 22:30 PM and press the red button in the manager's room. Game is saved automatically every new day.

- The more players, the more difficulty. (Try hitting players with the broom)
